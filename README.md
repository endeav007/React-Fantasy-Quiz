# Project Summary
This is a personality quiz in the style of a 'choose your own adventure' game. The user will get assigned a personality type based on their choices in each scenario. 

### Why am I making this?
I grew up enjoying choose your own adventure books, and I also love personality quizzes. I wanted to figure out a way to tell a story, while still giving the user time to reflect on who they are as a person,

## Built With
Vite + React

### Why React?
I've only worked with vanilla JavaScript, and wanted to try something new. I choose React because this project has a lot of interactive components and 
data that needs to be moved around based on clicks from the user.  What question number they're on on, the answer the user selects, and their past answers are all values
that will be constantly updated with each click.
