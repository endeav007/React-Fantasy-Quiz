        description: "You were the strongest in the party. You defended them with your life. You couldn't protect them from everything, but you always tried. ",
        paragraph1: "All throughout your journey, you’ve been the leader. You might not have always been the one at the front of the party, but you were the one making the plans. Guiding your team through to the very end. Your spirit embodied everyone else in the party, and they drew their strength from you. ",

        paragraph2: "They all relied on you. Sometimes too much. You had conversations about taking a step back. You tried to disperse the responsibility you held, but it’s in your nature to carry a bit more weight than everyone else. The Fighter has to be the strongest, emotionally and physically.",

        paragraph3: "As The Fighter, you knew that this fight wasn’t winnable. Honestly, you knew this better than anyone here. You should’ve known better. Maybe if you were stronger, you could’ve won this. Maybe this was your fault.",

        paragraph4: "Fighter, it’s not your fault. It’s not your job to know everything or care for everyone. If one person could handle everything, we wouldn’t have use for anyone else. ",

        paragraph5: "You were the last one standing. You held up the legacy of the party. "

        description: "It was your duty to keep them safe. They wouldn’t have gotten this far without you.",
        paragraph1: "There were many times when it seemed like it was the end. Your party members had accepted a fate, and were prepared for it to be over. You always knew it wasn’t. You brought about hope, pulling your friends out of the stickiest situations.",
       
        paragraph2: " This time felt different. This time, you had the overwhelming feeling that there wasn’t any way to come back from this. You reached deep inside yourself, but that light inside you had vanished. Without your hope, your faith, you’re nothing. A healer can’t fix anything without a little bit of hope.",

        paragraph3: "As the Healer, you should’ve known better. You’ve made wishes come true, granted blessings, and made the inconceivable happen. You of all people should know what’s impossible. Maybe this was your fault.",

        paragraph4: "Healer, it’s not your fault. You’re not a prophet, you couldn’t have known. It wasn’t just your hope that got them this far, your love for them played a part as well. ",

        paragraph5: "And your love never faded. "

        result: "The Caster",
        description: "You were the smartest in the party. You were not born with strength or abilities, but a passion for growth.",
        paragraph1: "Being the best was important for you. You spent most of your time alone before the party, dedicating yourself to your craft. You knew your magic well, but lacked in many other skills. Skills the party filled in for you. Though you couldn’t haggle down the price of an armor piece or hit a bullseye on a far away target, it didn’t matter. You could make the seller forget the price of an item or instantly bring the target closer to you. You did what was impossible.",
        paragraph2: "The party taught you so much about learning to live. Sometimes you look back on your old self, and wonder how you were fulfilled. Your old life was a lot less exciting. You spent time gaining new skills, and expanding outside your craft. Maybe this was the root of your downfall. ",
        paragraph3: "As the Caster, you should’ve known better. If you’d spent more time focused on yourself, maybe you could’ve been strong enough to make this fight winnable. You wasted time learning new things that didn’t help you at all. Maybe this is your fault. ",

        paragraph4: "Caster, it’s not your fault. If you hadn’t learned new things, you wouldn’t have even left your tower in the first place.",

        paragraph5: "You deserved a chance to live."

        result: "The Archer",
        description: "You were supposed to be a loner, but stuck with this team until the end.",
        paragraph1: "At first, your attachment was transactional. Joining the party was simply a way to get what you wanted. Being alone made you vulnerable, and vulnerability is something you feared. You can’t always be watching your own back. ",
        paragraph2: "Though with time, your motives changed. You weren’t used to being loved. It was both suffocating and comforting. You joined this group to escape vulnerability, not be overcome with it again. ",
        paragraph3: "So, you pushed back. They couldn’t possibly care for you if you only showed the ugly parts of yourself. The parts that wanted to bring tears and arguments. You got them to snap a lot, bite back, and affirm that you’re not worthy of their love. But every incident was followed with an apology. They never took away their love, no matter how much of your true self they saw. They cared for you, and against your better judgment, you started to care for them back.  ",
        paragraph4: "As the Archer, you should’ve known better. For once in your life, you had trust in the people around you, and it turned out like this. A part of you wished you warmed up to them a bit faster. You would’ve had longer to enjoy their company, and you would’ve been better at fighting with them instead of by yourself. Maybe this is your fault.  ",
        paragraph5: " Archer, it’s not your fault. It’s hard to trust people when you’ve been hurt so many times. Be proud of how far you had grown as a person. You became a vital member of the party."

        result: "The Storyteller",
        description: "You were the morale of the party. You supported them, keeping their spirits high throughout even the toughest of battles.",
        paragraph1: "You saw the potential the party had from the very beginning, from a time when their adventures only consisted of minor quests around the city. You encountered all the members of the party long before the party even existed. They all had something in common though. That spark of wanting to be something more. You brought them together, knowing that drive could lead to something great. And you were right. ",
        paragraph2: "They were going to save the world. You saw how much they’ve grown. The party had spent years chasing down the root of the evil brewing in the land and prevented it from spreading in the meantime. You had faith your team could take this on, and you were wrong. ",
        paragraph3: "Apparently, it wasn’t meant to be. Fate decided that you wouldn’t be the winners of this battle. You couldn’t overcome this evil. You have no idea why. It doesn’t make any sense. It simply isn’t fair.  ",
        paragraph4: "As the Storyteller, you should’ve known better. You shouldn't have gotten involved. You can’t tell a story and also be a part of it. Your actions must’ve shaped the outcome of the battle. Maybe this is all your fault. ",
        paragraph5: "Storyteller, it’s not your fault. There are many routes a story can take, especially one that’s still being written. You deserved to have your story told."
