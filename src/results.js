"All throughout your journey, you’ve been the leader. You might not have always been the one at the front of the party, but you were the one making the plans. Guiding your team through to the very end. Your spirit embodied everyone else in the party, and they drew their strength from you. "+ 

"They all relied on you. Sometimes too much. You may have had conversations about taking a step back. You may have tried to disperse the responsibility you held, and you may have succeeded. But it’s in your nature to carry a bit more weight than everyone else. The Fighter has to be the strongest, emotionally or physically."+ 

"As The Fighter, you knew that this fight isn’t winnable. Honestly, you knew this better than anyone here. You should’ve known better. Maybe if you were stronger, you could’ve won this. Maybe this was your fault."+

"Fighter, it’s not your fault. It’s not your job to know everything or care for everyone. If one person could handle everything, we wouldn’t have use for anyone else. " +

"You were the last one standing. You held up the legacy of the party. "
